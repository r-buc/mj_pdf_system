* 3.1.0
  * A correctness and stability release. A few new reading options, much safer saving and backups, and a long list of fixes.
  * New:
    * Single Page Mode shows one page at a time regardless of the window size.
    * Choose the page fit policy, so pages fit by width, by height, or whole.
    * A Controls Hide Delay setting in Customize Controls picks how long the overlay stays visible.
    * When the selected text contains a link, the web search button becomes an Open Link button.
    * Searching now happens without leaving the document.
    * The first jump lands in reading history, so Jump Back returns you where you were.
    * The previous and next arrows wrap around at both ends in every search flow.
    * When every match is behind you the search wraps to the first one, and says so when there are none.
    * Double tap zoom now uses two states by default, with the old three states available in Advanced settings.
    * The fullscreen exit button reads Exit Fullscreen instead of Exit.
    * A file shared from another app now asks before copying when it is very large or space is tight.
    * That dialog offers keeping a copy, granting file access, or just reading it once.
    * Keep Copies of Shared Files becomes a choice between always keeping a copy and asking each time.
    * The theme toggle button stays visible when the PDF theme follows the system.
    * Tapping it then explains why it cannot toggle and lets you pick a theme right there.
    * The book title snackbar fits longer titles.
  * Library:
    * A document can no longer land in the library with an unknown page count.
    * A document already stored with the wrong page count is corrected the next time you open it.
    * Documents are identified by the hash of the first and the last MB of the file, so two files sharing a first megabyte no longer merge into one.
    * Files under two megabytes are identified by their whole contents.
    * Existing records convert quietly on open, keeping reading position and bookmarks.
    * Conversion is anchored to the real file, so a copy can never claim another book's history.
    * Home's relocate picker now heals the record even after the screen is recreated.
    * The reader's relocate picker verifies the picked file before repointing the record.
    * Backing out of that picker exits the reader again as intended.

    * A spare copy is kept for password protected files too.
    * Saving a copy can no longer overwrite the file you are reading.
    * Updating a different file by mistake now asks you first.
    * Annotations can no longer be written to another document's chosen destination.
    * Saving no longer opens and re reads every highlighted page.
    * Saved files no longer grow with pages that did not change.
    * A saved file no longer balloons with a hidden copy of everything you read before saving.
    * Saving a file that was inflated by an older version shrinks it back to its real size.
    * Edits are refused politely while a save is running instead of being lost.
    * Deleting a document no longer races a reader that still holds unsaved highlights.
  * Highlights and Signatures:
    * Fixed highlighting in books where it silently failed.
    * Highlights no longer appear in a file that does not contain them.
    * A highlight that cannot be drawn now says so instead of pointing somewhere else.

    * Dragging a selection handle is smoother and no longer redoes work on every touch event.
    * A signature no longer lands sideways on a rotated page.
    * Dragging a signature now moves it the way you drag it.
  * Reading:
    * Navigation History opens whenever the trail holds anything, even when every entry is ahead of you.
    * The page you are on is now tracked wherever the view moves, so the number in the bar is always the page you are looking at.
    * Jumping to a search result or a highlight now leaves you on that page, so leaving and returning brings you back to it.
    * Auto scroll now keeps the page number, the reading history and the saved position up to date as it goes.
    * Fullscreen now covers the camera cutout area instead of leaving a black band on notched phones.
    * Reading position is no longer erased when Always Open at First Page is on.
    * Right to left books no longer jump to the wrong end of the document.
    * Right to left books no longer save the wrong page when you leave.
    * Pages are centered instead of pushed to one side.
    * A document no longer turns a page by itself when it opens.
    * The first tap after opening toggles the controls instead of being swallowed.
    * Contents entries no longer show page 0 or jump to page 1.
    * Contents rows that resolve to nothing now show nothing and do nothing.
    * A finished one page book shows 100 percent.
    * Two page spreads show both page numbers when you jump.
    * First Page Alone shows as overridden while Single Page Mode is on.
    * Double tap zoom stays within your configured maximum zoom.

    * A drag started right after a page turn is no longer ignored.
    * Auto scroll stops when you leave the reader and stays consistent afterwards.
    * Always Hide Margins now applies after you return from settings.
    * Rotate reads the real screen orientation, and explains itself when the system controls the window.
    * Rotation lock clears when you close the app.

    * Results are added to instead of being rebuilt from scratch.

    * Incognito stays incognito when the screen rotates while the file picker is open.
    * No lasting file permission is kept for a file opened in incognito.

    * Batch status changes create library records for never opened files.
  * Library Durability:
    * Documents are identified by content, so progress and status survive moves and renames.

    * Otherwise a relocate dialog lets you pick the file again.
    * Repicked files are verified by content, so reading progress is preserved.

    * Records converge to real file paths as documents are opened.

    * Removing folders from the scope keeps their PDFs visible in Folders.
    * Whole device scanning keeps its full speed.
    * The library fills near instantly on a fresh install using the system media index.
    * A background scan catches anything the index missed.

    * New Dual Page Mode pairs pages side by side like a book.
    * An optional First Page Alone setting keeps the cover on its own.
    * Paired pages fit two columns across the view, separated by the page spacing.
    * Taps, selection, highlights, forms, and signatures resolve the correct page of a pair.
    * Flings, page snapping, volume keys, and mouse paging advance one spread at a time.
    * Page indicators show a range like 4 to 5 of 120 for spreads.

    * Detection results are cached per PDF, with per page overrides.
    * Noisy page edges are handled safely.
    * A global option always hides margins for all PDFs.

    * Hide and Show Margins are available as reader and fullscreen buttons.
    * Changing the global setting now applies to the open document as soon as settings close.
    * A manual toggle made in the reader survives unrelated settings visits.
  * Auto Scroll:
    * Auto scroll moves by real elapsed time, so speed is consistent on every device.
    * It ticks on the display's frame clock instead of a timer loop.
    * Each speed unit still means 100 pixels per second.
    * Auto scroll pauses while you interact with the document.
    * The speed is remembered per document.
